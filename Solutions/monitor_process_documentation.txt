For Part 1 of Day 4 in TWSBashBlazeChallenge, we had to create a script that will check if a certain process is running or not. In case it is in stop state, it has to be restarted and a total of 3 attempts can be made while restarting a service. I have created a script that covers all of the above use-cases.
The script efficiently monitors a specific process on a Linux system. The script's primary goal is to ensure the process is always running, and if it unexpectedlystops, it should be restarted automatically; saving precious time and preventing unnecessary disruptions.

Please refer to the script in the same repo named "monitor_process.sh" which details all the steps required to achieve this! Also, in order to automate this, I have created a cron job to run every 5 mins. This will ensure that the service is being monitored at regular intervals and in case the service goes down, the system will automatically try to bring it up.
